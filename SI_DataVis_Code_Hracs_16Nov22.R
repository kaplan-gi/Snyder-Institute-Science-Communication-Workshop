# aes() # aesthetic mapping; how variables are mapped to aesthetic properties of the plot such as color, fill, shape, size, etc.

######################### BAR PLOTS ################################

# use grouped, stacked, and proportion bar plots as it makes sense for your data
# here stacked and proportion might not be the best choices
